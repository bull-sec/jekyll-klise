Decided to make a list of the channels I follow and blogs/websites I frequent, partly as a shoutout, and partly for anyone who may not know about these awesome folks and would like some more Warhammer content in their lives.

## Websites

- [Tale of Painters](https://taleofpainters.com) - Garfy and Stahly are two of my favourite miniature painters, their tutorials are excellent, and ToP has been in my bookmarks for a heck of a long time
- [CoolMiniOrNot] - Rate my mini dot com. Post your minis, get ridiculed, or be praised, the internet will decide your fate
- [DakkaDakka.com](https://dakkadakka.com) - CoolMiniOrNot, but the one that never left the early 00's design wise, loads of good stuff to marvel at, and loads of bad stuff to giggle at
- 1D4Chan RIP - The original place to go for completely unbiased and accurate Warhammer lore
- [Wahapedia](https://wahapedia.ru) - Based. If you don't know, get to know (and save an offline copy)
- [Cults3D](https://cults3d.com) - Nice site for STLs for 3D printers, the prices range from free, to reasonable, to downright extortion.

## Podcasts/Lore Channels

- [Adeptus Ridiculous](https://www.adeptusridiculous.com/) - Brick, DK, and Shy host the 40k podcast with the excellent motto "Entertainment before accuracy"
- [The Poorhammer Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@thepoorhammerpodcast) - Brad and Eric host the Poorhammer podcast, they inadvertantly end up doing lots of maths and talk crap about Space Marines, very based
- [Luetin09](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8RfCCzWsMgNspTI-GTFenQ) - The King of 40k Lore (imo), great to listen to when building or painting minis, his Ork videos are my personal favourite
- [Lorehammer Podcast(RIP)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq9af4kjJ_XFpu3kObtUkZQ) - AKA a bunch of Canadians read the wiki and shout at each other. Was a great podcast while it lasted.
- [DickCheck](https://www.youtube.com/@DiceCheck) - I'm gonna be honest, I just kinda love Bricky when he's in 40k mode, and who doesn't love a good battle report?
- [MiniWarGaming](https://www.youtube.com/@miniwargaming) - The OGs of battle reports on YouTube, MWGDave has the most infectious enthusiasm, and the craziest Chaos army
- [Arch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTSA_sWGM44) - My favouritest of the lot\*


## YouTube Hobby Channels

- [EricsHobbyWorkshop](https://www.youtube.com/@EricsHobbyWorkshop) - Eric just seems like the most chill guy, makes some excellent terrain and plays some cool games
- [Goobertown Hobbies](https://www.youtube.com/@GoobertownHobbies) - Brent is the Bob Ross of miniature painting, I think he also has like a PhD in chemistry, dude knows his stuff
- [Squidmar Miniatures](https://www.youtube.com/@SquidmarMiniatures) - A gang of Swedish lunatics that make some frankly ridiculous dioramas. Very based.
- [PeteTheWargamer](https://www.youtube.com/@PeteTheWargamer) - Pete does some ~~excellent~~ freaking amazing conversions, check him out!
- [BlackMagicCraft](https://www.youtube.com/@BlackMagicCraftOfficial) - Excellent tutorials on making terrain, and they make a really cool game called "Idols of Torment"
- [Midwinter Minis](https://www.youtube.com/@MidwinterMinis) - *mostly* Warhammer focused channel, Guy does all kinds, from scenery to painting minis and building Titans
- [Night Shift](https://www.youtube.com/@NightShiftScaleModels) - Scale Modeller and Diorama builder, you can pick up some brilliant tips for weathering your Rhinos here
