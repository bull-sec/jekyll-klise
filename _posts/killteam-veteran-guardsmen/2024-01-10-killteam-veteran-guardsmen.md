These are another bunch of minis I've had painted up for a while that I should have made a post about but just didn't for some reason, so to remedy that here's a load of pictures of my Veteran Guard killteam :)

Those gifted in mathematics might notice that there are more models than is legal to field in a Killteam, and that's because I expanded the models with the Krieg Command Squad from Forgeworld, they were the first resin models I've painted and they weren't too bad at all, though I suspect due to the size the amount of warping I've heard about was always going to be minimal.

## Recipe

Been a while since I painted these guys so I've had to really think about how I did them... but I remember deliberately keeping the recipe fairly simple because I wanted these guys to look like they actually fight in wars, and aren't out on parade (I hate clean models)

1. Start with a simple Chaos Black prime.

2. Their trench coats were done in Vallejo Model Color 70.830 (German Field Grey) and the pants were done in Vallejo Model Color 70.586 (Green Grey).

3. All the metal on the minis was base coated with Citadel Leadbelcher.

4. The whole model was given a nice coat of Citadel Agrax Earthshade for those brown tones in the recesses.

5. Then I went across each model with a light drybrush of Citadel Ushabti Bone to bring out the edges.

6. Those highlights are a bit strong at this point, so another wash of Agrax Earthshade will sink them back down

7. Pick out any obvious details that need to be highlighted (Sergeants Eye, Plasma Gun chargy bit)

And that is roughly the process, which ends up looking something like this!

I actually still need to do the *fine* detailing on these guys, but
