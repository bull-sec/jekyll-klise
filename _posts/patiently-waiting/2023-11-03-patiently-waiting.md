In the words of Homer J. Simpson: "The waiting game sucks, lets play Hungry Hungry Hippos!"

24 hour delivery my eye!

Anyway, since I'm bored and I'm waiting for this parcel to arrive, so lets talk about Nurglings.

They are one of the best things in Warhammer in my opinion.

Adorable little things, always happy, always having a good time, spreading diseases of unfathomable disgust.

If you don't look at a Nurgling and go "aww such a cute lil guy" then I don't know what is wrong with your brain.

Nurglings are peak Warhammer, because not only are they adorable, they are also absolutely disgusting. Which for me perfectly sums up the vibe that GW strives for, the mixture of serious and silly, because only in the Warhammer universe could something like this exist.

Look at this nonsense I found on the Wiki:

![Nurglings using a Human Psyker as a Warp portal](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammer40k/images/6/64/Nurgling_invasion.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160203190751)

Look at em, they're having an absolute ball! There is no malice here, they just want to spread their diseases and have a good time.

According to the Wiki, Nurglings are spawned inside Great Unclean Ones, so they're like little toxic clones (some folks on the Internet can relate to that)
