HAPPY HALLOWEEN! Hope you all have a spooky but fun day!

This is the first official post on this blog. So, to ease us in here's a scary story about how I spent a lot of money because I have no impulse control.

A few weeks ago I was up in Stockport doing a few bits, as I'm walking around I was listening to old Adeptus Ridiculous podcasts, and they were talking about Drukhari, a faction I've always been fascinated with. Long story cut short, my travels took me towards a place I should never be allowed near. Element Games.

Element Games is a Games Workshop reseller (amongst other things) and you can get some nice discounts from official GW pricing. I took a look at their site and they said they had a bunch of stock, so I had them bring me a few bits...

After an exchange of monetary units I left with what is essentially the entire Kabalite portion of a Drukhari army.

- 2 x Combat Patrols
- 3 x Reavers

The Drukhari Combat Patrol is *really* good value in my opinion (specially compared to others), you get 2 boats in each one which can be easily magnetised, 10 Kabalites, 5 Incubi, and an Archon. The boats come with a bunch of "hangers on" which can easily be converted into more Kabalites meaning there is technically 20 in each box.

(Yeah it's a pretty Kabalite heavy force right now :D)

While the combat patrol box comes with an Archon, they don't really feel like a true leader, and I felt like I needed an upgrade. So in the spirit of Halloween and being *spooky* I decided to pick up a copy of the **Crimson Court** from the Age of Sigmar, Soulblight Gravelords (a.k.a Vampire Counts).

They look exactly like the sort of lunatics I imagine lurk around the arenas and combat pits of Commorragh, and I can't wait to see them stood at the front of this horde of Kabalites.

I'll likely end up with a few left over weapons and Gribbly Bits* once I'm done assembling the Combat Patrols which will be used to make these folks a bit more 40k, but I like the idea of them being armed with melee weapons, fits the viciousness of Drukhari in my mind.

Hopefully the Crimson Court arrive in a few days and I can start work on them. But for now this felt like the most appropriate thing to talk about on this most spooky of days.

The next post will be a multi-parter detailing my exploits in building a gaming table. A project which was way bigger than I initially planned but I thoroughly enjoy building.

Have a good one, don't eat too many sweets.

> \* Gribbly Bits - the little bits and bobs on the sprue that you can use for kitbashing or to really add some flavour to a model - knives and pouches, pistols and emblems, those kinds of things.
