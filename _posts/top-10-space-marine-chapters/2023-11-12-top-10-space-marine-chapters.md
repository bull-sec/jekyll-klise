Just a quick caveat: I'm not a loyalist guy, I love my Xenos and my Chaos, I do enjoy reading some of the lore but for the most part I'm a casual observer. Generally speaking I find Space Marines to be on the boring side, and there is *so much* lore for them that "big man in armor stomp on bad guy" can get a little tedious.

All that being said, I still have a soft spot in my cold dark heart for a big snuggly marine in armor, and I have some favourites which have a particular aesthetic, lore or playstyle that I enjoy.

Let me know if your favourite made my list.

## Number 10




## Number 9


## Number 8


## Number 7

"There are no wolves on Fenris"

Big dog-man go **GRRR**

The Space Wolves.

I've never owned one, I've never painted one, but always thought they looked really cool with all the furs and the Viking aesthetic.

A dwarf loving friend of mine also loves him some Space Wolves, and he'd be most upset if they weren't on this list at some point.

I do enjoy the Space Wolves lore as well, especially how hypocritical they are with regards to psykers (that's a bit of a theme you might spot). I love them in the Black Libary: Horus Heresy books as well, specifically in "Prospero Burns" where they are very much depicted as the bad guys.

They are "the emperors executioners" and there it's one of those kind of open-secrets/generally accepted rumour that the Space Wolves have something to do with at least one of The Forgotten and The Purged (II'nd and XI'th Legions respectively) which is a pretty cool thing.

## Number 6

Dark Angels

*"BROTHER, I HAVE FALLEN!"*

*suspicious glare and the sounds of a bolter being cocked*

Ahh the Dark Angels, my second love!

One of the first Codex I ever owned was Codex: Angels of Death, which was a combined Blood Angels and Dark Angels Codex back in 2ed.

Here it is in all it's glory:

![Codex: Angels of Death](https://i.imgur.com/zPijsJL.jpg)

I bought this because I had a Blood Angels army when I first got into 40k, and this was how you got your rules for both the Blood Angels and the Dark Angels. (this was 2ed, everything was new, Dark Eldar weren't even a thing yet, no Tyrannids either)

Reading that I obviously found the Dark Angels bits, and I found that I really liked them.

I'll be honest, I just liked the dark green paint. I've always had a thing for the colour "British Racing Green" which is a very nice dark green found on old racing cars from the 80's, and the Dark Angels looked like someone had painted an entire army like they were headed out for a track-day. Excellent stuff.

Since learning more about the Dark Angels lore I now really enjoy the whole "Fallen" thing, and how they are super paranoid about anyone finding out. This is despite the fact that fully 9 Legions turned, so it's not like people don't know that Space Marines can fall to Chaos. Hell, that's why the (very based) Adeptus Sororitas distrust the Space Marines, because they *can* be corrupted and have been in the past.

If I had to pick a loyalist chapter to run in games again I'd likely go with Dark Angels, not that there is any danger of that happening any time soon, but never say never.


## Number 5

Blood Angels - my first love <3

This is the guy that sold 40k to me. LOOK AT HIM IN HIS MAJESTY!

![2ed box art](https://i.imgur.com/m2Boh24.jpg)
*40k Second Edition box art*

There is such a vibe to that old artwork isn't there? Look how derpy the Ork is! :D

The Blood Angels couldn't *not* be in this list somewhere. I was tempted to put them in at number one for nostalgia purposes but since I've learned more of the lore I've found there are other chapters I find much more interesting for various reasons.

They are by far my favourite of the original nine loyalist legions though. As you'll see in future posts, I have a bit of a thing for vampires, so Blood Angels is very much in my wheelhouse when it comes to an aesthetic. I love the super gothic angelic look, and Blood Angels do it the best.

Oh, and they have the best Primarch. Sorry all other loyalist Chapters, Sanguinius is *the best*, even Horus Lupercal agrees with me, I will hear no further argument on the subject.

## Number 4

The Black Templars.

![Black Templars in a last stand action](https://i.imgur.com/uUyvnYD.jpg)

These guys make me laugh, led into battle by the CEO of Racism himself, High Marshal Helbrecht, they are the Space Marines answer to the Adeptus Sororitas (Sisters of Battle). Religious zealots, constantly on a crusade to rid the universe of the three evils, the heretic, the alien, and the mutant.

They ride into battle on the back of pickup trucks (Implusors) while screaming scripture at their enemies, basically reenacting Sunday mornings in some of the more eclectic Southern States of the US.

Picking on Americans aside, the Black Templars are one of my favourite Loyalist chapters because they could not give a single hoot about the Codex Astartes. They are very much **not** a Codex compliant chapter because they have a good solicitor, and he's found a loop-hole that essentially says that if you're crusading, then you can expand beyond 1000 battle brothers. 

They stay on crusade. Permanently. And if anyone asks how many Astartes they actually have, well, accidents can happen in the grim darkness of the 40k universe, it's a dangerous place... 

*Inquisitorial Agent: "Brother Captain, what happened to my colleague that was sent to enquire about your Codex compliance?"*

*Black Templar: "Ahh yes, what an unfortunate incident that was. Poor fella slipped and fell out of an airlock. Bloody dangerous things, someone should put a sign near them or something"*

At this point they have been crusading for the best part of 9000 years, plus wherever we're up to in the current timeline (at the time of writing nobody is quite sure what the current date in 40k is)

Very interesting Chapter, make sure you see them as a satire of extreme behaviour and not an instruction manual and you'll be fine.

## Number 3

Death Watch

![Death Watch Marines](https://i.imgur.com/zJH9F0K.jpg)

There is something about the Death watch I quite enjoy.

They aren't "the best of the best" like Grey Knights, these are just the Astartes that have a penchant for the murder of aliens. And that's a theme I can get behind.

While my previous choice also have a penchant for killing xenos, they do it because they are religious zealots. The Death Watch do it because they are *damn good at it*. They also get to use xenos weapons and artifacts, because everyone in 40k is a hypocrite on some level.

The Death Watch is comprised of volunteers from a whole host of loyalist Chapters, and kill teams are typically made of Astartes from mixed Chapters, e.g. a Raven Guard, an Ultramarine, a Blood Angel, a Salamander, and an Imperial Fist might make up a six man kill team. 

On a side note, I've had my eye on that "Kill Team: Cassius" box that GW sell for a while as a cool little painting project, but can't really convince myself that I want it enough to part with the cash, and also there is [the pile](https://paintsplastic.com/the-pile-of-shame) to consider... One day perhaps...


## Number 2

Carcharadons

They're sharks! Who doesn't love sharks?! Sharks are cool!

The Carcharadons have a fair bit of lore as, but I'm not that up on it. It's mostly the aesthetic I enjoy with this Chapter, which has a very Pacific Islands (apologies if there is a better term, maybe Maori?) vibe, lots of tribal tattoos and scrimshawing, which is the decoration of bones. 

Very, very cool aesthetic for me, to the point where I'm super tempted to do a little kill team or something just to have *some* of these guys in my collection.

On the subject of their aesthetic, being "sharks" they favour close combat, and particularly bloody close combat at that, which is a Khorne approved method of "getting s**t done" so I'm a big fan of that aspect of the Carcharadons.

I don't have a whole lot more to say about them, this is probably the one choice I've made purely based on the look of the Chapter and their general aesthetic. Just a cool Chapter with a cool look that I enjoy.


## Number 1

It's the Ultrama-

Just kidding, it's the spooky, spooky skeletons!

The Legion of the Damned. 

I have adored these guys since I used to stare at the early models on the GW shelves. I got to use the store painted ones in a game once, I have no memory of how the game went but I do remember staring at those models the whole time I was playing, utterly obsessed with owning some one day.

*The old logo in it's 90's glory*

Old memories aside, for me they are just the freaking coolest things as far as Space Marines go.

They appear out of nowhere, wearing armor so black it appears to absorb light, they fight in silence rarely ever heard to utter a sound even when hit, they are surrounded by a cloak of ethereal flames, arriving just when the Imperium is on it's knee's to save the day. 

They are also *really good*. OK, so a Space Marine is *good*, but The Legion of the Damned are *damned good*\* and regular Space Marines look at these guys in awe.

Luetin does an amazing video on them, and he *absolutely nails* the end bit for me, I got really hype and started thinking about conversions before I had to reel myself back in and look at [the pile](https://paintsplastic.com/the-pile-of-shame).

~~Far as I know they aren't a playable unit any more,~~

Scratch that, [I found their Legends Datasheets from 8ed](https://www.warhammer-community.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/36e76afc.pdf) 

So I guess you can run them in 10ed if your partner is OK with it? Nothing stopping anyone from just making some though.

Anyway, they're awesome, spooky skeletons. Nobody knows where they come from or who they are, but they show up, stomp on fools, refuse to elaborate, then leave. That's why they're my favorite Space Marines.

*Oh, what a shock the Chaos loving guy likes the Space Marines that are covered in bones, and fire, and are probably some kind of warp daemons!*

Yeah... you got me there, I have no rebuttal.

Here's some art I found on the internet...

10/10 spookiest skelingtons in 40k. Love em.

> \*Oh yes, that was completely deliberate.
