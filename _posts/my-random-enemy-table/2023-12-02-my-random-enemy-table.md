I had an idea a while back to create a game mode that essentially takes Necromunda or Mordheim, depending on the flavour you fancied playing, and spawn random mobs for you to fight based on a table of all the "monsters" I have in my collection.

I also wanted a place to store this nonsense so I could access it when I was out of the house :D
