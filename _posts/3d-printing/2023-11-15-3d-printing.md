3D printing has become much more affordable and accessible over the last few years, I personally own both a PLA and Resin printer and have a whole bunch of stuff that I've printed off that I use on models (Chaos backpacks for my conversions being the main one)

## The Good

Ease of use.

Price.

So many amazing 3rd party models.

## The Bad

Quality

Some absolutely dog 3rd party models.




## The Ugly

OK, enough beating around the bush, let's talk piracy.

Piracy is an ugly business at the best of times.

Let me be clear at the top of this section: I do not support wholesale piracy of any media.

Sharing rulebooks if someone has already bought a copy I'm cool with, why do we all need our own copy of the rules? Also the rules should be 100% free, but that's a rant for another time.

But wholesale copying of an entire GW sculpt? Nah, that's where I'm going to draw the line personally. Yes the models are expensive, and yes they take time to assemble, but for me that's part of the enjoyment of this hobby. Getting that box home and peeling off the plastic film, then breaking out the clippers, hobby knife, and the Tamyia cement and turning bits of plastic into a miniature. I'd really miss that tactile experience if I went full 3D printer mode.
