Before I start this I want to make a few things perfectly clear.

- I have no issues with LGBTQ+ folks in general
- You are free to do what the hell you like
- Until Games Workshop does a thing, it is not a real

Been a **LOT** of argument regarding Female Space Marines recently, and I thought since I span up this blog I'd lay down my thoughts on the subject for posperity.

I don't like the idea of Female Space Marines (hereby refered to as FSM), mostly because I'm no loyalist. To me, the idea of GW (Games Workshop) releasing new Marines, doesn't matter which gender they are, is boring.

Another reason I don't like FSM is __because__ of the arguments it causes.
