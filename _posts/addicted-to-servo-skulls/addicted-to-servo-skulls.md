I have recently developed a slight addiction to building Servo Skulls.

I can stop whenever I like, it's not becoming a problem.

They're really simple to make, and the majority of them are just a skull + a bit of greenstuff, but they add so much to the overall 40k aesthetic.

The "bits" are mostly from a pack of random resin parts I bought from [GreenStuff World](https://www.greenstuffworld.com/en/) no idea which minis they are off, but there was a load of these little arm things in there and they are perfect to attach to the sides of my little minions.
