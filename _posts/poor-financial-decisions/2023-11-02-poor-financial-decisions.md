I really should not be allowed to have money and an active internet connection, it leads to very poor financial decisions.

In my [Halloween Post](https://paintsplastic.com/happy-halloween) I mentioned that I'd picked up the Crimson Court to kitbash as a sort of command unit for my Drukhari army. Those should be arriving tomorrow, along with something else...

I've been eyeing this up since it dropped, and then I spotted that ElementGames had a 20% discount and any resistance I had broke right there and then.

Excited to get my hands on these fellas though, my Chaos army currently consists of a *load* of cultists (think I have like 50 of em at last count), the Chosen from the old Dark Vengeance box and a box of the old Chaos Space Marines (they're so smol now) so an injection of 30 Beakies and 10 Cataphratci Terminators should be plenty.

Also comes with a nice hardback book which will look awesome on my bookshelf :D

This is not a flex, this is a cry for help.
