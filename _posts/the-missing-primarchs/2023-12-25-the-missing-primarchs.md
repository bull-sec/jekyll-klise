MERRY XMAS!

Since it's Xmas I thought I'd be a bit silly and go over one of my favourite things in 40k.

The Lost Primarchs!

I'll link all the referenced source material for this at the bottom (Uni paper style)

---

## Background

The Emperor of Mankind created 20 Primarchs to help him conquer the galaxy and unite The Imperium of Man. During the time of the Horus Heresy fully half of the Primarchs and the Legions would turn traitor, the rest staying loyal to The Imperium of Man.

However, this presents us with a simple maths problem. Because there were 20 Primarchs, but 9 traitor Legions, and 9 loyalist Legions. We have a remainder of 2! (*dun dun duuh*)

Seems like the II and the XI (2nd and 11th) Legions are missing? 

Well, to be technical about it (from the new Horus Heresy rule book), one is considered "Forgotten" and the other is considered "Purged" it's not specified which is which, but those are two pretty interesting words to use.

So, how the heck did we get here?

Well, nobody really knows, and the ones that do aren't talking about it. And that is the canon reason in lore. Seems like the erasure of the II and XI Legions is one of the best feats of censorship that the Imperium of Man has ever pulled off. We get tiny little snippets about them in the Horus Heresy books, not enough to make any judgement one way or another but just enough to stoke the fires of speculation.

And frankly I love that, because it gives us room to wildly speculate! And who doesn't love a bit of wild speculation in a fantasy setting? On Xmas as well!

So, we have the two lost legions, and their two lost Primarchs, we know nothing about them or what they were like. So this could be a really short post but I promised wild speculation and dammit we're gonna speculate wildly on what happened to the two missing Legions, and who they might have been!

*Warning: Some of these theories are going to get pretty hairy, but remember that this is just a bit of fun, hope you're having a lovely festive peroid*

## Theory #1



## Theory #2

XENOS LOVING FILTH

Premise: One of the lost Legions was destroyed by the Space Wolves because they got a little bit too familiar with some Xenos species.

Supporting Argument: It's the Imperium of Man! If you had Xenos loving Astartes Big E would be **FUMING**, specially back in the early days of the Crusade. So yeah, not too much of a stretch this one. Maybe the Primarch was made with too much compassion or empathy and takes pity on Xenos because they stand no chance against the Legiones Astartes led by Primarchs.

## Theory #3

THEY BOTH FELL TO CHAOS

Premise: Both Legions fell to Chaos *prior* to the Horus Heresy.

Supporting Argument: Honestly this is one of my weaker theories because the lore doesn't support it. OK, so there isn't any lore on these Legions, but there should be if they fell to Chaos, because presumably at some point one of the other Chaos Primarchs would bump into them or at the very least be told about them, which hasn't happened at all. So based on a lack of evidence, but in a specific way that proves our case... wait this is supposed to be a supporting argument isn't it? Dammit.

## Theory #4

CRAZY GENETIC MUTATIONS

Premise: One of the Legions suffered from horrific genetic mutations, to the point where the whole Legion had to be "purged" for fears of it spreading.

Supporting Argument: We know that the Legions, and their subsequent successor Chapters are all susceptible to various genetic mutations and psychological abnormalities. The Blood Angels are vampires amongst *other things*, the Thousand Suns were/are literally wasting away, Space Wolves turn into Werewolves. We have plenty of evidence to support the idea that these two Legions were so badly affected that they had to be destroyed.

## Theory #5

FOREVER WAR

Premise: The two lost Legions are at war with each other and have been fighting for 10,000+ years somewhere in the galaxy.

Supporting Argument: They have been referred to as being "absent", which implies they are still alive, so what the heck are they doing.

## Theory #6

FOREVER WAR 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO

Premise: The two lost Legions are fighting a war inside The Emperors webway gate.

Supporting Argument: We know the Emperor was working on a webway gate on Terra, and we can surmise that he started this before the Crusade. So it could be that the two Legions were selected to go and hold off the Daemons and whatever else is spilling out of the gate. But since that project is *super secret* they've made up some other story to cover the fact that they are missing, all the while these two Legions are fighting away in a forever war against god knows what inside the Human webway that will never be completed.

## Theory 7: 

## Theory 8: 

## Theory #9

## Theory #10

## Theory #11

## Theory #12

THEY WERE DEAD THE WHOLE TIME!

Premise: There were only ever 18 Primarchs, the Emperor engramatically embedded the idea of two "purged" and "forgotten" Brothers into the Primarchs to enstill an additional sense of loyalty through fear.

Supporting Argument: OK, so we know the Emperor is a *super* powerful psyker, and he appears to wear a "glamour" which distorts his appearance depending on who he is trying to impress or scare. So is it that out of the question that he could implant the idea of 2 missing brothers into the minds of beings he literally created from scratch to instill a fear of failure into them genetically?

There is additional evidence to support this theory if we disprove some of the others.

- We know they are loyalist[1]()
- If they fell to Chaos someone would have seen them, surely?
- If they are still around as loyalists in some form, where the heck are they?
- There is no proof that they are helping with the webway project whatsoever
- There is no evidence to suggest they are fighting a war with each other, and someone would have seen the destruction by now
- Genetic mutations is still a decent shout, but then they are referred to as "The Forgotten and The Purged" so my theory only accounts for one if those names are a canon suggestion of what happened to each Legion
- Speaking of them is not *really* forbidden, it seems to happen a lot in the Horus Heresy books, but the conversation just gets shut down quickly with a "we're not supposed to talk about this" and a frosty look

So lets quickly summarise; nobody has ever seen them, we can't contact them in any way, speaking of them is forbidden (kinda), and if they had fallen to Chaos then surely they'd have popped back up by now in one way or another.

If I had to put my money on one of these wild theories, it would be this one, mostly based on the *overall* lack of evidence to support the existence of these Legions in the first place aside from a rumour/suggestion that the Space Wolves were involved with destroying one or both of them.

It could all just be a massive psychological ploy by Big E to instill a sense of loyalty and fear into his "sons", i.e. you don't want to mess up because you'll end up like "The Forgotten and The Purged". And the more I call them that the more they sound like the sort of thing you'd make up to scare children into eating their vegetables "oh best eat your carrots and peas or 'The Forgotten and The Purged' will get you!".

And there we have it, a suitably festive amount of theories for the festive season, I'm sure you'll agree.

Hopefully you enjoyed reading my wild speculation, maybe you have your own theories on the lost Legions? Hit me with em, or tell me you agree with one of mine, socials are all linked somewhere, I'd love to hear from you.

Hope you have a lovely festive period.
