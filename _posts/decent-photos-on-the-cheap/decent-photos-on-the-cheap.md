I'm bad at taking photographs, I don't have a single good selfie and a few of my ex-girlfriends have lamented my inability to operate a camera.

The trouble is, taking photos of miniatures is sort of important if you want people to see them (and you don't want them all in your house), but professional photography equipment is expensive, so I had a think and a Google as to how to take "half-decent" photos of my minis without breaking the bank (and ideally without spending much at all)

> Bear in mind that I'm in no way a professional and my advice should be taken as that of a rank amateur

We're going to need a few things:

- Camera
- Lights
- Background
- Some minis

## The Camera

OK, so if we want to take photos, we're going to need a camera.

Now we could go down the road of picking up a DSLR, or some other good quality camera. But that's going to be expensive, and frankly, a waste of time considering the fact that I (and likely you) already own a smart phone.

In my case it's a Samsung S23, with a 50MP rear-facing camera which I'm told is very good, and a quick Google search brings up plenty of guides on how to properly make use of the "Pro" mode. "Pro" mode lets you change various settings in order to get your perfect picture. I've linked a guide on the Samsung "Pro" mode features below, but there is plenty of higher level information available.

[Community Guide on "Pro" Mode](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Tech-Talk/Camera-pro-mode-in-depth-guide/td-p/3317971)

There are also plenty of YouTube videos, and I'm positive that you'll be able to find a guide for your particular device in order to get the best out of it.

OK, that's our camera boxed off! Now we need some lights!

## The Lighting

You can go absolutely mad with lighting, and from my quick research it seems that it's quite possible to spend just as much on lights (if not more) than you might spend on a decent camera.

But we don't need to light up anything particularly big (yet) so for our purposes some LED lights will do just fine.

Note the plural "lights", i.e. more than one. The idea is that we want to minimise shadows, and to do that we use multiple light sources.

If you have some spare cash you could splash out on a "light box", these are little boxes with multiple light sources specially designed to take photos in, but we're trying to do this on the cheap

These are great, they have a few different lighting modes, and they bend so you can get them into the right position.

I've found plenty of free guides available on setting up the lights, you can find one linked below to get you started:

## The Background

The main idea here is that we either need to present the minis in an aesthetically pleasing way.

There is no real right and wrong here, but there are some things you should avoid, such as backgrounds that have a lot going on, or feature unrelated art.

For example, if you were taking photos of your Chaos Warband for Mordheim you'd likely want to avoid using "Codex: Space Marines" as the background image.

Below is one of the first attempts I made using an AoS battlemat I got in a copy of Stormbringer Magazine (the only copy I've ever bought). As you can see, the minis get drowned out because the background is so busy.

As you can see, the minis (especially as they aren't even primed yet) blend into the background making it really difficult to see any details from a quick glance.

Plain white and plain black work well. I find white can be a bit harsh, but for miniatures with brighter base colours (i.e. blues/reds) the light background can really make the miniature pop off.

## Goals

For those of you who frequent the Warhammer socials, you may know Garfy.

Garfy has upped their game BIG TIME recently, including fog and different lighting effects. The pictures make the minis look so damn cool!
