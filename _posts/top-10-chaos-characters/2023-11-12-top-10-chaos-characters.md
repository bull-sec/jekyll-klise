## Number 10

Vashtor the Arkifane.

I've still yet to read all of the Arks of Omen books myself, but I did get a nice breakdown from listening to AdRid and reading various bits and pieces around the internet.

Vashtor is SUPER INTERESTING. And I **hope** that his introduction opens the door for some Dark Mechanicus shenanigans miniature wise, because that would be awesome!

Oh Vashtors model is amazing. And will be added to my collection in the new year at some point.

## Number 9

Number 9, the number of Tzeentch.

The changer of ways, the keeper of secrets.

So who better for the ninth spot on my list than Ahriman of the Thousand Sons, who are dedicate to the worship of Tzeentch.

## Number 8

KHARN!

I freaking love Kharn, aka Kharn the Betrayer.

## Number 7

You should be onto this particular theme by now... for 7th place we're going with a worshipper of Papa Nurgle, and my choice is of course, Typhus.

Typhus is the Death Guards' Erebus. He is such a bad man. I love him.

## Number 6

Representing Slaanesh, it's Lucious the Eternal!

Lucious is a complete ass.

## Number 5

## Number 4

Erebus.

God I freaking hate Erebus.

But I also love the fact that I hate him so much. He is such a twisted and evil individual, there is absolutely nothing about him to like, and yet here he is, at number four on my list.

While there are no "good guys" in 40k, everyone is on a sliding scale of evil somewhere, Erebus is most certainly one of the bad guys. He is a proper villain, the kind that is sadly too evil to die, so his death will forever be just out of reach until GW decides otherwise.

## Number 3

I was tempted to put The Emperor of Mankind in this list to be a trouble causing lil' gremlin, but I'll settle for picking the leader of the Red Corsairs, Lufgt Huron. (I know, quite the departure)

## Number 2

Fabius Bile.

Oooh threw you a curve ball there didn't I? I am a Bile simp, I've said it before and I'll likely say it again, he is one of my favourite characters in 40k, full stop.
