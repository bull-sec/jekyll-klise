It suddenly dawned on me that this blog is called "Paints Plastic" and I've barely done that, or shown off anything I've made. 

Well it's time to correct that!

These are my current Work in Progress (WIP), a band of 12 Pink Horrors of Tzeentch.

Why 12? Because they are actually intended to be ran as part of a Daemons of Chaos Killteam, with the other part being some Plaguebearers (you may have already spotted Frank and Geoff in my [gaming board project](https://paintsplastic.com/gaming-board-part-1).

Rules for Killteam say 6 Daemons to a squad and a full KT is 2 squads, so on the off-chance I feel like running all Pink Horrors one day I have enough to do so :)

Getting the two extras for both the Horrors and the Plaguebearers was fairly cheap, I used [bitzbox.co.uk](https://bitzbox.co.uk) and just picked up some bodies as the box contains more than enough arms and heads to do two more (that's for both the Horrors and Plague bearers).

## The Horror

I've gone for a pretty simple scheme for these guys (which is a theme you'll see a lot with my painting)

Started with a Chaos Black prime

Then went in with a drybrush and did some *heavy* highlighting across all of the Horrors with ProAcryl Bold White Titanium. I believe this is called "zenithal highlighting" but I'm not sure that's actually what I've done here, so heavy drybrushing it is!

It's actually amazing how effective a simple drybrush pass can bring out all of the details

After the drybrushing it was time to apply a base coat, which highlighted my need to invest in a good airbrush and pump (*sigh* always another thing to buy) but the crappy one I had just about managed to apply a relatively smooth coat of Citadel "Pink Horror".

After that had dried it was time to apply a wash, and I decided to go with Citadel "Druchi Violet" which is one of my favourite Purple washes.

That really gave them some nice volume, with the wash sinking into all the crevices and giving the bright pink a darker hue (I *really* love a purple wash) after that had dried I pondered my next move, and decided to go with another round of heavy drybrushing, this time with a *much* lighter shade of Pink, namely Citadel "Fulgrim Pink" which is almost an "electric pink" but a bit more towards the white end of things.

And that's as far as I've gotten with these lads.

As it stands I'd quite happily run these guys in a game, but I want to go in and get all of the details then maybe apply a dark wash across the whole model to bring the tone down a bit, and obviously the bases need some texture and some skulls.

## Split

Apart from the detailing which clearly has not been done, the other reason these guys are marked as "WIP" is because I don't own any Blue Horrors.

For those that don't know, Pink Horrors have an ability called "Split", which gives them the ability to split into two Blue Horrors when they are killed, those Blue Horrors then split down into two little bug things which eventually die and you have no more units.

But just think about that for a second.

I have 12 Pink Horrors, if they were all to die, I would need 24 Blue Horrors to replace them... and if those Blue Horrors were all to die I'd need 48 of the little bug things to replace those!

That's a lot of minis for what started out as one box and some extra bits to make up the extra bodies. So until I'm actually playing regular Killteam games I think I'll be swerving that particular money-sink.
