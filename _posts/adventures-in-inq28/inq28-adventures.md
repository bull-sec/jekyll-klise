I've always loved the smaller skirmish style games that GW has released over the years, I still have a big green place in my heart for Gorkamorka, and I was super excited when they made the frankly excellent decision to bring Necromunda back. I my opinion the smaller scale allows for more customisation and story telling with your miniatures and the games themselves are shorter so you can play more.

One night I found myself looking around for rulebooks and other information on these smaller scale games, with the idea of picking some of them back up again, and came across an odd hashtag.

> #inq28

Curiosity piqued, I dove straight into the rabbit-hole.

## What the heck is #inq28?

TL;DR #inq28 is GW's Inquisitor TTRPG played at 28mm scale.

"What do you mean? Aren't all GW games 28mm scale?"... well, yes and no... GW minis have their own scale so 28mm is not actually strictly accurate but it'll do for the purposes of this post.

Anyway, let's have a quick history lesson.

Presumably off the back of the success of Mordheim in 1999, in the year 2000 Games Workshop released a game called Inquisitor, it was a smaller narrative based skirmish style TTRPG much more in the style of DnD than a standard Warhammer game, as it encourages the use of a GM (Game Master) and it used 54mm miniatures.

People liked it, but it didn't last very long and was eventually shelved by GW in much the same way as Gorkamorka, Mordheim, and Necromunda (before they re-released the latter a few years ago)

The general idea of the game is two or more players control a small warband made up of the characters and creatures that we see and hear about in the books and lore. The games themselves are far more narratively driven than your typical game of 40k, and the GM was encouraged to come up with interesting scenarios for their players to get involved in.

Sadly it didn't seem to fit in with what GW wanted to do moving forwards, and they decided to put a stopper on it and their other skirmish games. Add to that the idea that it's far more narratively focused and it uses different scale miniatures and you can start to see why GW chose to shelve it.

... However, this is the age of the Internet, and to quote H.P Lovecraft - "*That which is not dead can eternal lie*". 

Inquisitor wasn't dead, because you can't kill an idea, and once an idea takes hold it's hard to completely kill it.

And the idea of "small games with cool characters" had fully taken root and was not going to go away any time soon.

## Making an #inq28 Warband

This is where the fun begins.

I've had the thought myself, and seen a lot of people ask "How do I get started?"

You just, kinda start.

#inq28 doesn't just encourage kitbashing, it feels like it's a central theme of the game, and really pushes you to be creative when assembling your warband.

There is no "box set" you can pick up which would contain everything you might need (casually ignoring the "Inquisitorial Agents" KillTeam for the moment... we'll get to that...), and that's because it's entirely up to you how many characters are in your warband and what they are equipped with.

It's probably easier to show you a warband I made to give you an idea what you should be aiming for. So let's do that!
