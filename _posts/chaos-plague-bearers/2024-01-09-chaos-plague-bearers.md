You may have spotted two Plague Bearers named Frank and Geoff being used in my gaming board project, and I thought it was a shame that I didn't make a post about them, so here they are, along with the other 10 members of the team.

As I mentioned before, these guys are meant to be used as part of a Chaos Daemon Killteam, with the [Pink Horrors](https://paintsplastic.com/chaos-pink-horrors), which is why there are 12 of them. The extra bodies were sourced from the same place as last time ([bitzbox.co.uk](https://bitzbox.co.uk)) and if I recall correctly I grabbed an extra sword.

Anyway, less talk, more pictures of Plague Bearers.

## Recipe

Always find it's nice to include the recipe for any minis I post, someone might want to copy it, or take inspiration from one of the steps.

1. Chaos Black Prime (as always)

2. Citadel Nurgling Green base coat on all skin areas, pick out any bone in Citadel Corax White, and Metallics in Citadel Leadbelcher

3. Wash with Citadel Agrax Earthshade

4. Drybrush with Citadel Ushabti Bone

5. Apply copious amounts of Citadel Blood for the Blood God and Nurlgles Rot technical paints
