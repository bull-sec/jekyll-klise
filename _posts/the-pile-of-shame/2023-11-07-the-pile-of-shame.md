Everyone has a pile of shame in one form or another.

The piles range from a couple of minis, to entire armies. Much to my shame, mine falls into the latter category.

I feel like using this as a bit of a therapy session and also take the time to make a list of the stuff I have to get through that's still sat in a box.

Yeah, it's not a small pile.

OK, lets break down the contents of the pile and put the true levels of my shame out there for all to see.

From the top of the pile:

- 2x Wardog Armiger/Helverin boxes
- 3x Wardog Karnivore/Executioner/Brigand boxes
- 1x Knight Tormentor
- 1x Knight Abominant

(so that's a full Knight army...)

- 2x Drukhari Combat Patrol boxes
- 3x Reaver boxes\*
- 1x Wytches box\*
- 1x Kabalite box\*
- 1x Crimson Court box

(and that'll be a big chunk of a Drukhari army...\*the sprues are inside the Combat Patrol boxes to save shelf space)

- Cursed City
- Blackstone Fortress (minus one Kroot)
- Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness

(that'll be 3 full game boxes... minus that one Kroot)

- 1x Leviathan Siege Dreadnought
- 1x Land Raider Proteus
- 1x Forgefiend/Maulerfiend
- 1x Blooded Kill Team
- 1x Gelerpox Infected Kill Team
- 1x Box of SoB Battle Sisters (bought to make a Kill Team)
- 2x Ogryn boxes
- 1x Chaos Cultists
- 1x Chaos Acursed Cultists
- 1x Box of Plague Marines
- 1x Fabius Bile (I had to)
- 1x Plague Marine Champion (for the Sassy Nurgling)
- 1x Start Collecting Genestealer Cults box (minus one cultist head)

That's just the stuff on the shelf still in boxes. I've got a couple of assembled squads and Necromunda gangs in my immediate TODO pile. (Escher Gang is on the hobby mat as I awkwardly type this over the top of them)

The Chaos stuff has been sat around for a long time because I couldn't come up with a paint scheme, [but that's boxed off in my head now](https://paintsplastic.com/painting-the-court) so I'll be starting work on those soon(tm).
