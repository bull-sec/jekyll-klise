I've always been fascinated with building terrain and scenery for wargaming, many moons ago I even owned a copy of "How to make Wargames Terrain" as published by Games Workshop. I think back then I made a house and a hill, but never really ventured any further as I didn't really play the game and was suffering from a chronic lack of disposable income.

Well, times change, and I want to get into playing more, and I have a bit more disposable income these days. So I said "screw it" and decided that I needed a gaming board in my life.

## Design Choices

Before I started work I set out some basic requirements for the board, as while disposable income and time are things I have, storage for a giant gaming board is something I don't really have. So I set out a list of requirements.

- Must be modular/collapsible
- Should be big enough to host a full size 40k game
- Needs to be compact enough to fit in the corner of my hobby room when it's not in use

I watched hours of YouTube videos, and took a dive into the depths of the internet to find inspiration. And [eventually I came across this blog](https://waaaghblog.com/mordheim-board-part-1-the-foundation/). The size of the board was a bit too big, but the idea of having an "inside" to the board which instantly gives it a degree of verticallity appealed to me. So the final idea was born.

- 4, 60x60cm wooden "boxes"
- The tops of the "boxes" would be left open
- Inside of each "box" would be have a different theme
- XPS foam would act as the "topper" 

## Initial Construction

I suck at woodwork.

I don't have the proper tools, and I don't have a dedicated space to work in, but that's not a major issue when places like B&Q exist (generic hardware store in the UK). I popped along and picked up some MDF and pine boards, and had them cut it all to size for me on their giant wall saw, I then had to get it all back home on a train but that's a story for another time.

Picked up a few extra bits and pieces like a new saw, nails and some wood glue while I was in B&Q, and set to work on building 4 "boxes".
