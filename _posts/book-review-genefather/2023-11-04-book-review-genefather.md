I've never written one of these before so bear with me :)

[Genefather by Guy Haley - Black Library Link](https://www.blacklibrary.com/prod-home/new/ebook-genefather-eng-2023.html)

Genefather by Guy Haley is the latest book to feature everyones favourite Mechanicus character, Belasarius Cawl. The plot is fairly straightforwards, Cawl is trying to get support to do *something* about the Cicatrix Maledictum, and heads off to petition some Houses of Mars for support. Meanwhile Fabius Bile is on the prowl, and has his eyes on the artifact that that Guilliman gave to Cawl which contains essentially the blueprints for the creation of the Primarchs, the Sangprimus Portum. This sets up a nice little confrontation between the two characters at the end of the book where we get a bunch of lore reveals and some intruging threads to pull on for future stories.

One of the things I did enjoy is the consistency in Fabius Biles character despite this book being written by a different author to the Fabius Bile series of books (a review of which is in the works). He (Bile) is (in my opinion) one of the more interesting characters in the 40k universe, and we get to see that in this book. We don't get quite the same amount of insight into his character and the goings on of his Consortium in this book, but this time Bile is here to be the antagonist so that can be forgiven.



## Voice Acting

John Banks does a stellar job at voicing the main characters, he has done the previous three Fabius Bile books, so he's got it down to a fine art now and the gritty tone he puts on for Bile really gives an impression of a grizzled old veteran. Oddly he uses a very similar voice for Cawl, and I felt that it was deliberate to highlight the similarities between the two characters, of which there are many, the main one being that both of them (Cawl and Bile) are considered radicals by a lot of their peers, and there is a lot of suspicion surrounding the pair and the sort of experiments that they get up to. It's an interesting choice.

I love the voice John uses for Qvo-89 as well, he just sounds so defeated, constantly, and it really adds to the flavour of the character for me.

Top quality voice acting overall, if you're like me struggle to find time to sit down and read, then the audiobook version is highly recommended.

## Spoiler Warning

From this point on I will be spoiling parts of the story, so if you've not read it, and don't want to be spoiled, then go read the book and come back later :D

## Belasarius Cawl, Heretek

How this man is still alive in the 40k universe boggles the mind. There are numerous mentions of how if anyone finds out some of the things he's done how he would be branded a Heretek, and in my opinion he's already crossed that line and come back around the other side a few times.

This is my first experience with Cawl as a character, I've not read any of the other Cawl books, so it was quite interesting to see how he's portra

## Fabius Bile, Most Dangerous Man in 40k

One part of the book that I found equal parts hilarious and frustrating was people not giving Bile the respect he deserved as an adversary. The only person who gives him any credit is Cawl.

This book added fuel to a particular question that's been gnawing at the back of my head for a while: Is Fabius Bile a Chaos Space Marine, or is he a Renegade?

Bile himself would tell you that he is nothing like the Chaos Space Marines, and looks upon them as degenerates that gave in to their baser instincts. And the more I read of Bile the more I'm inclined to think that he is a Renegade. The facts speak fairly loudly as well; Bile has repeatedly declared his disdain for Chaos and the powers of the Warp, even going so far as to call a Keeper of Secrets a "Figment" to it's face. He can also be quite merciful, and he doesn't kill for the sake of killing as so many of his former bretheren, he detests waste, and the gleeful slaughter they engage in during combat just looks to him to be a waste of potentially valuable material for his research and experiments.

We see the "mercy" he shows in the final confrontation with Cawl, he could quite easily have murdered Cawl (or rather Porta could have) and 

- Doesn't think of himself as a Chaos Space Marine
- Wants to "save humanity"
- But wants to do it by killing off all the regular humans and replace them with his "new men"
- Is WAY more dangerous than anyone in the book gives him credit for

## Qvo-88/89

I found the bits with Qvo-88/89 fascinating. Cawl clearly has a lot of affection for his old friend, but there is a certain maliciousness involved in refusing to let the man die, and it creates a very interesting dynamic between the two, with Cawl constantly referring to Qvo-88/89 as Fredish, which seems to infuriate the Qvo's who typically respond "but I am not Fredish", to which Cawl replies "not yet". The Qvo situation draws on the similarities between Cawl and Bile even further, as they both attempt to create their own "new men" and find themselves emotionally attached to their creations. 

## Alpha Primarus

Oh boy, lets try and unwrap whatever the heck is going on here.

OK, so at no point in the story do any of the characters blatantly say it, but it's heavily implied that Cawl has created his own Primarch in Alpha Primaris, with Cawl referring to him as "my son" during a conversation with Bile. Or at least that was my takeaway.

This has some serious implications if it's accurate. Does this open the door to new Primarchs being created? Cawl still has access to the Sangprimus Portum, but it sounds like it took him a LONG time to make Alpha Primaris, so maybe not? 

## A word on FSMs

I was told to go read this book as it apparently supports the Female Space Marine idea, or more specifically, the idea that the lore *is* changing to support the inclusion of women into the Astartes.

Maybe it's just me, but I didn't really get that at all and I think folks are reading into things a bit too much and seeing what they want to see. (or maybe it's me that's guilty of that?)

The idea that Bile has created his own "new humans" might be what's adding fuel to this particular fire, but those aren't Female Space Marines, they are Glandhounds. Though I can see where folks might be putting two and two together here. If you've read the previous Bile books you may remember that Biles "new men" are created specifically to hunt Space Marines in packs, with the ultimate goal of extracting the Space Marines' Progenitor Gland (the thing that has the geneseed in it), but they aren't nice things, they are carefully crafted genetic mutations bred for combat. Most importantly, they are not humans, they are something else. Porta is an absolute beast, and she gives a good account of herself when she comes up against Alpha Primaris, a very impressive account actually.

Perhaps it's the idea of Cawl creating Alpha Primaris. There are some very interesting story threads to pull on here, but I just didn't see anything that particularly jumped out to me as hinting that the lore would be changing to make Female Space Marines a thing.

At the end of the day, until GW say "FSM is now a thing" it isn't a thing, and we can debate about it until the cows come home but nothing will change. 

My overall opinion on the subject, just for the record, is that I don't think FSM add anything of real value to the setting or hobby, and that adding *more* Marines is quite a boring thing for GW to do in general. This isn't a politically motivated opinion, and I'm not getting into gender politics, I say this from a pure hobbyist standpoint, I just don't see it really changing much. That being said, if you want to kitbash some female heads onto your Marines and run them as FSM, go for it, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Warhammer is for everyone except people who want to be dickheads, and that door swings both ways, you can be a left-wing dickhead and a right-wing dickhead or you can just roll dice, paint models, and have fun doing it.

I'll refrain from going into this any further for fear of enraging one side or the other in this debate and getting drawn into a political debate.

## Conclusion

I'm a Bile simp, so I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

To me Bile is one of the most interesting characters in the 40k universe for reasons I've already stated.
