WE HAVE PROGRESS! I REPEAT! WE HAVE PROGRESS THIS IS NOT A DRILL!

And significant progress at that!

Any of you reading this from the UK will know that XPS foam isn't as readily available as it seems to be in some countries as it's not massively common in our construction, as such it's not cheap. It's not super expensive either, but it's expensive enough, and having to get it delivered means that I've been hesitant to start cutting it with a knife for fear of ruining it.

So I caved in and bought a hot wire foam cutter. [This one specifically]()

This is one of those tools you don't need, but it's so nice to have, and after getting it setup and testing it out with some scrap pieces of random XPS and polystyrene I had some "straight" lines cut into my 1200mmx600mmx30mm XPS boards.

OK, so they aren't mathematical marvels, but it's good enough for my purposes, and the cut itself is super smooth which is going to make painting a nicer experience. I'm pretty sure with patience and a really sharp knife I could have gotten just as good a result, but I lack patience and spending the money incentivised me to actually get it done now that I had no more excuses.

Anyway, you didn't come here to read about the inner workings of my mind, you are here to see foam get chopped up.

## Planning and Preparation

The main goal was to have an "infinitely" variable board layout using streets, now obviously infinite is a stretch, but I figured 24 board sections
