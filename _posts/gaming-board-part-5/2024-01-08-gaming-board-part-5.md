WE HAVE PROGRESS! I REPEAT! WE HAVE PROGRESS THIS IS NOT A DRILL!

And significant progress at that!

Any of you reading this from the UK will know that XPS foam isn't as readily available as it seems to be in some countries as it's not massively common in our construction, as such it's not cheap. It's not super expensive either, but it's expensive enough, and having to get it delivered means that I've been hesitant to start cutting it with a knife for fear of ruining it.

So I caved in and bought a hot wire foam cutter. [This one specifically]()

![Proxxon Foam Cutter]()

This is one of those tools you don't need, but it's so nice to have, and after getting it setup and testing it out with some scrap pieces of random XPS and polystyrene I had some "straight" lines cut into my 1200mmx600mmx30mm XPS boards.

OK, so they aren't mathematical marvels, but it's good enough for my purposes, and the cut itself is super smooth which is going to make painting a nicer experience. I'm pretty sure with patience and a really sharp knife I could have gotten just as good a result, but I lack patience and spending the money incentivised me to actually get it done now that I had no more excuses.

Anyway, you didn't come here to read about the inner workings of my mind, you are here to see foam get chopped up.

## Planning and Preparation

Over the Xmas I found myself without a laptop with a few hours to kill between eating too many roast dinners and visiting family, so I made some little card backed map sections to play around with.

The main goal was to have an "infinitely" variable board layout using streets, now obviously infinite is a stretch, but I figured 24 board sections gives me plenty to play around with. I ended up with a set list of sections I wanted, as opposed to a specific design, and those ended up being:

- 6x Straight Roads
- 4x Cross Roads
- 3x T-Junctions
- 3x Corner Roads
- 3x Straight Canals
- 2x Canal Corners
- 1x Canal Docking area
- 2x "Blanks"\*

I actually really like these little blueprint things, and I spent more time than I'd like to admit playing around with different layouts just to see what I could create.

If you're planning on doing something like this yourself I'd highly recommend making some of these first.

## Nicely Chopped

With the templates cut out and sections decided it was time to actually start cutting foam.

Cutting small bits of foam is super easy, and you have all the control in the world, if you have the same Proxxon as me you can use the (admittedly slightly crappy) guiderail as well. 

None of what I've just said applies to cutting 1200x600mm boards.

I was limited to doing it in 30cm sections just because of the way the Proxxon arm is shaped, so that first cut involved me balancing 90cm of XPS with one hand while guiding the rest through the razor thin hot wire. As the boards got smaller they got far easier to cut, and the cuts that I did to split them in the other direction (if we say the first cuts were horizontal then these were vertical) were far easier to do, and you can tell.

But I got them all cut, then set to work with a Sharpie.

![Get to the D-ocks]()

I genuinely didn't mean it to look like that... but then I added the wavy lines for the river and *oh god what have I done*

But I digress, here's the rest of the cut up boards with less suggestive markings :)

## Laying Pavements

To give the idea of "pavements" and to give some additional texture to the boards I decided to use 5mm foam board.

It's great stuff, pretty cheap, cuts really easily with a craft knife and it's just the right depth at 5mm.

Glued these down with [Gorilla Glue]() which is perfect for working with XPS foam as it's non-toxic so it won't melt but it grips like cement once it dries, which it does at a very nice pace, giving you plenty of time to make sure things are set in the right positions.

Not much else to say beyond that, so here's some pictures and we'll move onto the next step.

## Texturing the Boards

This was a stage I was dreading, but it turned out quite well.

I've never done this before, but after watching what feels like 10,000 videos I made my mind up that a mix of Modpodge, PVA, and Acryllic Paint wasn't going to kill me or damage my foam, but at the last minute I decided to add some pre-mixed PolyFilla (spackle to any Americans reading this), and a handful of really fine sand meant for use in a vivarium. I have no idea what kind of ratios I used, but I managed to mix up enough to cover 16 of the boards, and I'd already decided that the ones with the pavements were going to be done first with the other 8

## Finishing the Priming

## The Other 8

~~So what of the other 8 boards?~~

The 8 is now 6 I just don't have pictures yet.

Two of them have been completely coated in the remainder of the texture paste, turns out there was still a bit left at the bottom and on the sides of the Polyfilla tub.

The other six present a slight height issue, as I was planning on cutting the center of the canal pieces out completely, but that means they will just kind of be floating over the 60x60cm boxes, which doesn't work because physics is a thing no matter how much I try to ignore it. So I need to come up with a solution for those before I can get them up to the priming stage.

They will likely be the subject of the next post, which will hopefully be next Monday after a productive weekend of hobbying.
