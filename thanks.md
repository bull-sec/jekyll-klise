Just want to say a big thank you to the folks who make the things that inspire me to continue with this hobby. You're all amazing! 

Check out the [Links](https://paintsplastic.com/links/) for a  big ol' list of the folks that inspire me!

And I'd also like to thank my employer, for allowing me to indulge in my plastic addiction. Very based.

If for some reason you would like to thank me (stranger things have happened), my twitter handle is the same as this site, I'd appreciate a nice message, or even a nasty one to be fair, would just be cool to know someone was reading this and had some feelings about something I'd written! :D 

I also have a few links you can click on, one of them is to buy me a coffee or the equivalent of, the rest are referal links which give me some sort of a little bonus if you buy something after using the code.

Thanks for reading x
